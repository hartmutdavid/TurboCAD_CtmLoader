# TurboCAD_CtmLoader
Here is a program to import CTM files into TurboCAD.

Before importing into TurboCAD, the CTM file is converted 
into an OBJ file. This OBJ file is then used by
TurboCAD read through the COM interface. The OBJ file contains the 
graphic data in a readable text form.

Tested with Delphi 10.x and TurboCAD Pro Platinum V.2020/2021.
